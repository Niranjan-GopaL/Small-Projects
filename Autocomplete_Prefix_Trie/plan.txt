- a Prefix Tree like this :- 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie


-   Dot and Graphviz is MIND BLOWING, we can
    use them to visualize graphs SO FUCKING COOL 

HOW TO RUN :- 

0)      input ALL THE WORDS IN inp.txt that you want to autocomplete for
1)      ./build.sh
2)      open the svg file


HOW IT WORKS :-

1)      Python parses through the words in inp.txt and generates a trie
2)      py code also generates a .dot file (GRAPH VISUALIZER)
3)      inside build.sh ==> dot -Tsvg render.dot > render.svg
4)      svg will have the diagrams
