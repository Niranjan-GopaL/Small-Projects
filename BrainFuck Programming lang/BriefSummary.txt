It's an Esoteric programming language ( meant to be fun and not practical)
Just 8 valid characters everything else is a comment

+  - Increments the byte at the location
-  - DEcrements the byte at the location
> and < moves the location to left and right respectively
[ ] are kinda like a while loop , 
[ means if the byte is True (not zero) it'll run the code till it reaches the ] and if the byte was 0 it'll skip entire code inside
. printf out
, take in one byte from user
