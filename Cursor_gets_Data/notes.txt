In JavaScript, the addEventListener method is used to attach an event listener to an HTML element, 
such as a canvas, a button, or a div. An event listener is a function that is called every time a 
specific event occurs on the element, such as a click, a keypress, or a mouse movement.


In this example code, we are attaching a mousemove event listener to the canvas element using the 
addEventListener method. The mousemove event is triggered whenever the mouse cursor is moved over the element.


The event listener function takes an event object as its parameter. The e.clientX and e.clientY 
properties of the event object are used to get the X and Y coordinates of the mouse cursor relative 
to the top-left corner of the canvas element.
